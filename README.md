    <h1>Scheme Interpreter (Python)</h1>
    <section id="about">
        <h2>What is Scheme?</h2>
        <p>Scheme is a dialect of the Lisp programming language known for its simplicity and elegance. It's a functional language with a strong emphasis on recursion and higher-order functions. Scheme is often used for teaching programming concepts and as a foundation for other languages.</p>

        <h2>About This Interpreter</h2>
        <p>This Python-based interpreter provides a basic implementation of the Scheme language. It supports a subset of Scheme features, allowing you to explore the language's core concepts and syntax.</p>
    </section>
    <section id="features">
        <h2>Supported Features</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Basic Arithmetic: +, -, *, /</li>
            <li>Comparison Operators: =, <, >, <=, >=</li>
            <li>Boolean Values: #t, #f</li>
            <li>Conditional Expressions: if, cond</li>
            <li>Definitions: define</li>
            <li>Lambda Expressions: lambda</li>
            <li>Procedure Application: Function calls</li>
            <li>Lists: Creation, manipulation, and access</li>
            <li>Special Forms: quote, car, cdr, cons</li>
        </ul>
    </section>
    <section id="usage">
        <h2>Usage</h2>
        <p>To run the interpreter, execute the interpreter.py script from your terminal. This will start a read-eval-print loop (REPL) where you can enter Scheme expressions.</p>
